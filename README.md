# Description

The student's of Old Dominion University's CS 312 were asked to 
redesign the homepage of a public school's website.  This repository 
features my code for the webpage that I designed in Fall 2023.  

My webpage was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it can be found here:
https://cs.odu.edu/~cs_enova003/

The schools original homepage can be found using this link:
